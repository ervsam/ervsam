# Hey! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px">

👨‍🎓 I’m Ervin, a third year student studying Computer Science in National Tsing Hua University. During my three years, I have had a taste of some of the various fields of 
Computer Science including threading in Operating Systems, building websites using React and mobile apps with Kotlin.

I recently took a course on Database Management Systems where I learned the architecture behind a DBMS. This involved the query parser and Plan/Scan tree of the query engine, 
and also file management, concurrrency and recovery implementations of the storage engine.

🎸 In my free time, I play guitar and listen to music. I love watching Netflix and Modern Family is my personal favorite.

📚 I also love reading, particularly books on personal development. Two of my favorites are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and Deep Work by Cal Newport. These books have shaped and is constantly pushing me to improve the productivity of my work.
