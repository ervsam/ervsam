# Hey! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px">

👨‍🎓 I’m Ervin, a third year student studying Computer Science in National Tsing Hua University. During my three years, I have had a taste of some of the various fields of 
Computer Science including threading in Operating Systems, building websites using React and mobile apps with Kotlin.

I recently took a course on Database Management Systems where I learned the architecture behind a DBMS. This involved the query parser and Plan/Scan tree of the query engine, 
and also file management, concurrrency and recovery implementations of the storage engine.
